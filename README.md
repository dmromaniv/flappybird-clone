# Flappy Bird Clone

Welcome to the Flappy Bird Clone project! This is a recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game using the PixiJS. This README will provide you with an overview of the project structure, features, and instructions on how to run the game.

The player controls a bird and navigates it through gaps between pipes. The game includes a score counter, obstacles, and the ability to save the player's high score. Additionally, players can view their gameplay statistics after each round and toggle sound effects on/off.
